  <h1>One-click play+fullscreen via YouTube API</h1>
  Suggested code from this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20289540/288906">StackOverflow answer</a>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on [play fullscreen]</li>
    <li>Click on the fullscreen button in youtube's player to exit fullscreen</li>
  </ol>

  <script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"></script>
  <button>play fullscreen</button><br>
  <div id="player"></div>

  ## Safari 8

  It works perfectly:

  0. Enters fullscreen
  0. Exits fullscreen

  ## Firefox 35

  Buggy, annoying but working:

  0. Enters fullscreen (on Codepen.io)
  0. Enters fullscreen (YouTube.com)
  0. Third click: Exits fullscreen

  ## Chrome 40

  Buggy, broken:

  0. Enters fullscreen (on Codepen.io)
  0. Does nothing
  0. Third click: Exits fullscreen but the video fills the iframe, effectively breaking the site. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CHibfEN.png" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>


  ## Mobile browsers

  This is the default behavior on iPhone, but it cannot work anywhere else (Android, iPad) since

  * to `play()` a video or to `requestFullScreen()` you need a user tap **in the same document** (read: not across the iframe)

  This means that

  * you can't call `requestFullScreen()` when the video emits the event `onplay`
  * you can't trigger `play()` via YouTube API (it would cross the frame) **and** call `requestFullScreen()` in the same tap

  So with one tap **either** you play the video **or** get it fullscreen; you'll always need two separate taps if you use YouTube.
